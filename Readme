# Django and React Setup

This guide will walk you through setting up a Django backend and a React frontend.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python, Django, Node.js, and npm installed on your system.

## Django Setup

1. Create a virtual environment. Navigate to your preferred directory and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate
   ```

3. Install Django:

   ```bash
   pip install django
   ```

4. Create a new Django project:

   ```bash
   django-admin startproject myproject
   ```

5. Navigate to the new project directory:

   ```bash
   cd myproject
   ```

6. Create a new Django app:

   ```bash
   python manage.py startapp myapp
   ```

## React Setup

7. Navigate back to your root directory and create a new React app:

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app frontend
   ```

8. Navigate to the new React app directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

9. Install Axios to enable React to send HTTP requests to Django:

   ```bash
   npm install axios
   ```

## Connecting Django and React

10. In your Django settings file (`myproject/settings.py`), add your new app to `INSTALLED_APPS` and configure the CORS headers:

    ```python
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # Other apps...
        'corsheaders',
        'myapp',
    ]

    MIDDLEWARE = [
        # Other middleware...
        'corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware',
        'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
        # ...
    ]

    CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST = [
        'http://localhost:3000',
    ]
    ```

11. Install the Django CORS headers package:

    ```bash
    pip install django-cors-headers
    ```

## Running Your Project

12. To start your Django server, navigate back to the Django project directory and run:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

13. To start your React app, navigate to the React app directory and run:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

Remember to replace "myproject", "myapp", and "frontend" with your actual project, app, and frontend names. Ensure both Django and React servers are running when you want them to communicate.
